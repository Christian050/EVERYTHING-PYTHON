# Calculate total cost of all items in a shopping cart


prices = [10, 20, 30]

total = 0

for item in prices:
	total += item
print(f'Total: {total}')


'''
'item' could be called anything.


In a situation where you need to add up items in a list in a for loop, 
create a variable name to recieve the sum of numbers in the list and print
outside the loop.


Always print the product outside the loop no matter what mode of 
calculation.
