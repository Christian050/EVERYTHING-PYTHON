The 'round()' function sums up the figures to the nearest 10.


Absolute, known as 'abs()' in python syntax is a function
that recieves a value and returns a positive representation
of the value even if it's negative.


To write a program that involves complex mathematical
calculations, the 'math()' module is used. It is
imported like:
				'import math'

to the code and becomes an object. 

math.ceil() is used to get the ceiling of a float.
Increases the number to the nearest 0.
Eg.
		math.ceil(2.4)
		Output: 3

Eg.
		math.ceil(-2.9)
		Output: -2

math.floor() decreases the value of a float to the
lowest 0.

The math module in python 2 is slightly different than
python 3.

Open python 3 on the web Browser and search for
python 3 math module to learn about the math
module.
