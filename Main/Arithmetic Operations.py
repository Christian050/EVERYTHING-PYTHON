FPN = Floating Point Number

FPN is any number in decimal format.

Division.

'//' is a division operator which returns
an integer while '/' returns a
floating point number.

The modulo '%' returns the remainder of the
division.


Exponent (Power).

The exponent is indicated with '**'.


Agumented (Enhanced) Assignment Operator.

Indicated by two assignment operators,
the augmented assignment operator makes
it easier to make changes to a code.
Eg. x += 3.

Some examples of agumented assigment
operators are:
+=
-=
**=
/=
*=

The first arithmetic operator in the
agumented assignment operator determines
what changes you're going to make be it
add'+', subtract'-', divide'/' or
exponent'**' while the second operator,
the equal sign'=' assigns the values together.
It is necessary to add the equal sign '='
after the operator.
